!! NAME
!!
!!  pt_advanceRK_pc
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  call pt_advanceRK(real(in)   :: dtOld,
!!                         real(in)   :: dtNew,
!!                         integer(in):: ind)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Time advancement routine for the particle module.
!!  
!!  This version implements the improved Euler method, also called Heun's method,
!!  for integration in time. The improved Euler methos is one of the family of
!!  2-stage, second-order Runge-Kutta methods.  (It can probably also be framed
!!  as a simple Predictor-Corrector method, with a first-order predictor and
!!  corrector.)
!!
!!  In detail:
!!      x*(t+dtNew) = x(t)  + dtNew *        v(x(t),t)
!!      x(t+dtNew)  = x(t)  + dtNew * 1/2* [ v(x(t),t) + v(x*(t+dtNew),t+dtNew) ]
!!      v(t+dtNew)  =  v(x(t+dtNew),t+dtNew)
!!  where x* is ephemeral (a predicted position that then is corrected after
!!  another evaluation there).
!!
!!  Implementation detail:
!!  This can be rewritten to save on memory for intermediate result storage:
!!      x*(t+dtNew) = x (t)        + dtNew *          v(x(t),t)
!!      x(t+dtNew)  = x*(t+dtNew)  + dtNew * 1/2* [ - v(x(t),t) + v(x*(t+dtNew),t+dtNew) ]
!!      v(t+dtNew)  =  v(x(t+dtNew),t+dtNew)
!!  where x* can be stored in the same location as the previous and final x.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!   dtOld -- not used in this first-order scheme
!!   dtNew -- current time increment
!!   ind -- index into pt_typeInfo and into pt_containers[] array for this type of particles
!!
!! SIDE EFFECTS
!!
!!  Updates the POS{X,Y,Z} and VEL{X,Y,Z} properties of particles in the particles structure.
!!  Sorts particles in the particles structure by calling Grid_sortParticles.
!!
!! NOTES
!!
!!  No special handling is done for the first call - it is assumed that particle
!!  initialization fills in initial velocity components properly.
