REQUIRES physics/Gravity/GravityMain/Poisson

# NOTE!  Because the unitTest is at the same level as the Poisson solver, none of the solvers
#  get picked up.  You MUST do ./setup unitTest/Poisson3 -auto -with-unit=phyics/Grid/GridMain/Poisson/Multipole -3d 
#  (or something like that)

D errn_variable	      	  analytical minus calculated potential, divided by analytical potential
