This file contains the indices of the various variables used in 
the EOS routines.  The first seven indices (EOS_VARS) are basic properties
whereas the last eleven indices (EOS_VARS+1 to EOS_NUM) represent derived 
or optionally calculated quantities.

The derived variables are used in the mask required by Eos.F90, and
values for them are returned by Eos in the array eosData when the
corresponding mask element is true.

NOTE1 -- originally both EOS_ENER and EOS_EINT were included here.  
EOS_ENER was the variable (mostly) used internally, and EOS_EINT was basically 
  ignored.  This was very confusing, as the EOS routines work with internal
  entergy, which corresponds to EINT_VAR in the unk array.  Hence, on
7/20/2006 LBR removed all references to EOS_ENER by changing them to EOS_EINT.

NOTE2 -- the equivalent Flash2 variable is given in [brackets] after the 
  description below

quantity EOS_VARS 9
quantity EOS_DERIVS 14
quantity EOS_NUM 23

NOTE3a -- kinetic energy EKIN is not actually used by any Eos implementation,
but a place for it reserved among the "basic" variables so that an Eos-wrapping
function can conveniently store the kinetic energy derived from grid
datastructure variables across Eos() calls.

basic EOS_DENS  Density  [rho]
basic EOS_TEMP  Temperature [temp]
