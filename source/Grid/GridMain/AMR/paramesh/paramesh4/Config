D gr_sanitizeDataMode What to do when gr_sanitizeDataAfterInterp is called
D & to check for acceptable values in the dens, ener, and eint cell-centered variables
D & after a Grid operation may have resulted in grid interpolation.
D & 0: Do nothing.
D & 1: Check (if variable is not masked out) and report (see sanitizeVerbosity).
D & 2: Check (ignoring variable mask) and report (see sanitizeVerbosity).
D & 3: Check (if variable is not masked out) and fix (apply floor value).
D & 4: Check (if variable is not masked out) and abort if cell is found below floor value.
PARAMETER gr_sanitizeDataMode	INTEGER	1	[0,1,2,3,4]

D gr_sanitizeVerbosity How to write information about unacceptable
D & values in the dens, ener, and eint cell-centered variables if gr_sanitizeDataAfterInterp
D & finds value that are below the acceptable floor.
D & This reporting is in addition to other actions selected with gr_sanitizeDataMode=3 or 4.
D & 0: Be quiet.
D & 1: Only write a log file message per block if unacceptable value found on MASTER_PE.
D & 4: As 1, and each proc writes a line to standard output for each block with bad values.
D & 5: As 4, and each proc writes lines showing the values in all cells of the block (in 1D/2D)
D & 5: or a 2D slice (in 3D).
PARAMETER gr_sanitizeVerbosity	INTEGER	5	[0,1,4,5]

D enableMaskedGCFill When enableMaskedGCFill is FALSE, Grid_fillGuardCells is forced
D &                  to always ignore optional mask arguments when present in calls.
D &                  This is the default behavior.
D &                  Set enableMaskedGCFill TRUE to enable masked guard cell filling.
PARAMETER enableMaskedGCFill BOOLEAN FALSE
