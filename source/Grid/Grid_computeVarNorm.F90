!! NAME
!!  Grid_computeVarNorm
!!
!! SYNOPSIS
!!  
!!  call Grid_computeVarNorm(integer(in)  :: level,
!!                           integer(in)  :: normType,
!!                           integer(in)  :: ivar,
!!                           real(out)    :: norm,
!!                           integer(in)  :: leafOnly)
!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Computes the L1 or L2 norm of the variable specified by ivar.  This
!!  can be done per-level, or on leaf or all nodes.  For multigrid, the
!!  L2 norm is used for convergence, but the L1 norm is incredibly useful
!!  for debugging purposes.
!!
!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  level     - If the norm is restricted to a given level; 0 is all
!!  normType - p in the Lp norm where choices of p are 1 or 2
!!  ivar      - the grid variable being normed; -1 for work
!!  norm      - the variable with which to return the norm
!!  leafOnly - if this isn't 0, compute the norm only on leaf nodes
!!
!! RESULT
!!
!!  The norm of ivar is in norm.
!!
!! EXAMPLE
!!  
!!  gr_restrictTree()
!!  do i = 1, lrefine_max
!!    call Grid_computeVarNorm(i, 1, pdens, norm(i), 0)
!!  enddo
!!  do i = 1, lrefine_max
!!    if (norm(0) - norm(i) > 0.0000001) then
!!    driver_abortFlash("restriction is highly nonconservatory!")
!!    endif
!!  enddo
