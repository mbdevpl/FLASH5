## Implements a Lazy File class
# Associated with a file which is regenerated afresh and never read from.
# This class doesn't write the actual file till the file is closed
# even then it writes only if the new contents and the current contents 
# are different.

class LazyFile:
   """Defines a file like class which supports the following:
      * __init__ associates a real file with this class
      * write adds a line for writing to the file (but does not actually write)
      * close reads the real file, compares it with buffer contents
        if doesnot match rewrites the entire file, else silently returns.

      NOTE: Useful only if you want to rewrite the entire file, small files (memory requirement)

      Usage: file = LazyFile("filename")
             file.write(string1)
             file.write(string2)
             ...
             file.write(stringn)
             file.close() --> if reqd this is the one which really does all the writing
