# Initialization methods of spatial distribution for tracer particles
# [source/Particles/ParticlesInitialization]

# Submodules:

#   WithDensity      Distribute the particles randomly, using the gas density as the
#                    distribution function.
#   Lattice          Distribute the particles on a uniform lattice.

REQUIRES Particles/localAPI

D When this parameter is set to True, the last in use
D tag value will be reset to 0. 
PARAMETER pt_resetTag  BOOLEAN   FALSE

#DEV: CD. The PartInit variable makes sense only if 
#we have one particle type.  It seems it was never used anyway, 
#as PartInit is not in any setup shortcut or test suite
