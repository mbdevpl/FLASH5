Hello World
-----------
This is the Default setup that tests the stubs

This is a sample Unit Test, which prints "Hello World!" 5 times on the 
master processor. The exact greeting as well as the number of times it is
printed is defined in flash.par 

Problems?

1. After the setup is run, if we look at the "Setup_initnameValueLL.F90" file,
   the lines for greeting and repeat come twice.
2. The driver_global uses the simulation data directly, which is not a good idea
   in general. Is there a clean way for Driver_global to get access to runtimeparameters?
