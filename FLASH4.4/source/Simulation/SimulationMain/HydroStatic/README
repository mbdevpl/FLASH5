Adding new simulation "HydroStatic" for demonstrating, and playing around with,
boundary conditions, esp. hydrostatic ones.  To be used in FLASH tutorial.

As it is, this simulation only works with the "Constant" Gravity implementation,
since it assumes existence of "gconst" and "gdirec" runtime parameters.

Simulation_initBlock just fills the region according to a barometric formula
equivalent to
     \rho\ (h)=\rho\ (0) e^{-Mgh/RT} 
assuming constant Gravity, an idea gas EOS, constant temperature, height-dependent
pressure and density; where:

    g = the acceleration due to gravity
    T = Absolute temperature
    R = Ideal gas constant
    M = Molar mass
   \rho = Density
    h = height 

Cell values of variables are taken to be the cell center values, no attempts
are made to take account of the fact that FLASH3 assumes cell values to represent
volume averages instead.  No subsampling (or any other methods that could be used
to increase accuracy) is used.

Default and example values for parameters are approximately like terrestrial conditions.

This should be usable in 1D, 2D, and 3D.  The direction for the "height h" can
be chosen along the X, Y, or Z axis.

Boundary conditions provided:

A Grid_bcApplyToRegionSpecialized.F90 which
  o  implements a USER_DEFINED boundary condition type, which simply fills boundary
     guard cells according to the same static formula used in Simulation_initBlock
     (but handles velocity components as for REFLECTING boundaries, and handles
     face variables, if present, as for OUTFLOW boundaries);
  o  for HYDROSTATIC,HYDROSTATIC_NVDIODE,HYDROSTATIC_NVOUT,HYDROSTATIC_NVREFL
     uses the FLASH3-provided gr_applyFlash3HSEBC() implementation (which must be
     configured in);  ** THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY COMMENTED OUT - KW **
  o  for HYDROSTATIC_F2,HYDROSTATIC_F2_NVDIODE,HYDROSTATIC_F2_NVOUT,HYDROSTATIC_F2_NVREFL
     uses the FLASH3-provided gr_applyFlash2HSEBC() implementation (which must be
     configured in);  ** THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY COMMENTED OUT - KW Oct 2012 **
  o  falls back to default handling by Grid_bcApplyToRegion in other cases
     (by returning applied=.FALSE.).

The simulation simply initializes the solution variables hydrostatically, and then lets
Hydro loose on it.  The less happens, the better: It's supposed to be static after all.
