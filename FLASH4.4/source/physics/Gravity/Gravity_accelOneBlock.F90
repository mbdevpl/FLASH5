!! SYNOPSIS
!!
!!  Gravity_accelOneBlock(integer, intent(in) :: block, 
!!                        integer, intent(in) :: ngcellcomp
!!                        real(:,:,:,:)),intent(out) :: gvec, 
!!                        integer, intent(in),optional :: potentialIndex)
!!

!!
!! DESCRIPTION
!!
!!  Compute components of the zone-averaged gravitational
!!  acceleration for this block.  Include ngcell layers outside
!!  block interior.
!!
!!  This routine computes the gravitational acceleration for
!!  zones in a given block. First-order
!!  finite-volume differencing is used everywhere.  It is assumed
!!  here that the requisite number of guard cells have peen appropriately
!!  filled for the variable containting the gravitational potential.

!! ARGUMENTS
!!
!!  block           -  metadata for the block, such as its integer bounds, refinement level etc
!!  gvec(:,:,:,:)   -  Array to receive gravitational acceleration
!!                        as as NDIM-dimensional vector.  It is assumed
!!                        the the space provided is the size of the block
!!                        plus all guard cells.  The fist index is the vector
!!                        component and the latter are cell indices.
!!  ngcellcomp         -  Number of layers outside of block interior to
!!                        compute gravity
!!  potentialIndex     -  if specified,  Variable # to take as potential.
!!                        Default is GPOT_VAR for the potential stored in the
!!                        gpot slot of unk, which should correspond to the
!!                        potential at the current timestep.
