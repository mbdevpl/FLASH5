#       Parameters:

# Note that the the following two are not actually defined at this directory level.
D         grav_boundary    External boundary condition to use for Poisson solver
D           &                 (applied to all boundaries):  0 or ISOLATED : isolated,
D           &                 1 or PERIODIC for periodic, 2 for Dirichlet (?).
D           &                 Not a runtime parameter but derived from one.
D         grav_boundary_type  String-valued version of grav_boundary.  Accepts:
D           &                 "isolated", "periodic", "dirichlet", and maybe others,
D           &                 depending on the Poisson solver used.
D           &                 This is declared in the stub level of the Gravity unit
D           &                 to allow the Grid unit to refer to this runtime parameter
D           &                 even when no Gravity implementation is included.

D grav_temporal_extrp  extrapolate or otherwise rescale
PARAMETER grav_temporal_extrp  BOOLEAN FALSE          

D updateGravity allow gravity value to be updated
PARAMETER updateGravity BOOLEAN TRUE   

D grav_unjunkPden controls whether Gravity_potentialListOfBlocks attempts
D & to restore the part of the "pden" ("particle density") UNK variable that
D & is due to particles, or leaves "pden" as it is, after a Poisson equation solve.
D & This only applies meaningfully when a "pden" variable is declared
D & and the gravitational potential is calculated by solving a Poisson
D & equation whose right-hand side includes a mass distribution to which
D & both hydrodynamic fluid density and massive particles contribute.
D & The "pden" variable will have been set to the sum of the fluid density
D & ("dens" variable) and the density resulting from mapping massive particles
D & to the mesh,
D & so that is what remains in "pden" when grav_unjunkPden is set to FALSE.
D & Otherwise, "dens" will be subtraced from "pden" before Gravity_potentialListOfBlocks
D & returns, and "pden" will be left containing only the mass density that is due to
D & particles.
PARAMETER grav_unjunkPden BOOLEAN TRUE


#	Self-gravity requires that the density be defined as a variable.
#	This should be ignored by setup if the hydro module (which also
#	defines "dens") is included.
VARIABLE dens TYPE: PER_VOLUME # density

D gpot_variable Gravitational potential set by current time step
D gpol_variable Gravitational potential from previous step, or intermediate value after Hydro call
VARIABLE gpot      # grav. potential at current step
VARIABLE gpol      # grav. potential at previous step (or at an intermediate time)

#	All implementations of Gravity that do not merely apply a field
#	constant in time, including self-gravity implementations, should
#       define the FLASH_GRAVITY_TIMEDEP preprocessor symbol.
#       When FLASH_GRAVITY_TIMEDEP is defined, code in other units may
#       assume that variables gpot and gpol exist in UNK with meanings
#       as above.
PPDEFINE FLASH_GRAVITY_TIMEDEP


D point_mass    mass of the central point-like object
PARAMETER point_mass         REAL 0.e0

D point_mass_rsoft softening radius for the point-like mass (in units of
D &                 number of the finest level cells)
PARAMETER point_mass_rsoft   REAL 0.e0
