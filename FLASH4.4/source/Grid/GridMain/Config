D convertToConsvdForMeshCalls indicates if appropriate variables are
D & converted from primitive to conserved form during propagation
D & before control is passed to Paramesh for refinement, derefinement,
D & or guardcell filling.  This is the old way of ensuring that
D & solution variables are in the correct form for interpolation. It
D & involves unnecessary conversions back and forth and should be
D & obsoleted by the newer mechanism enabled by runtime parameter
D & "convertToConsvdInMeshInterp".  The name is a replacement for the
D & old "conserved_var" which many people have found to be very
D & confusing terminology.

D bndPriorityOne indicates which direction (IAXIS, JAXIS, or KAXIS) gets
D & top priority when applying boundary conditions in corner guardcells
D & We define three values for edges left, center, right, of which center 
D & represents interior, while left and right represent the corresponding
D & guardcells. We define a corner where more than one dimension has its
D & its guardcells, so the application must determine which direction gets
D & to fill them. In 2-D, there are four corners: (left,left),
D & (left,right), (right,left) and (right,right). In 3-D case, the following
D & corners are possible : (left,left,left),(left,left,center),
D & (left,left,right),(left,center,left),
D & (left,center,right),(left,right,left),
D & (left,right,center),(left,right,right)

D gr_bcEnableApplyMixedGds whether to enable the Grid_bcApplyToRegionMixedGds interface
D & for implementing boundary conditions with access to the variables of mixed
D & GDSs (in particlular, cell-centered UNK varsiables and face variables).
D & This only has an effect if the GridBoundaryConditions subunit is included and
D & the simulation actually supplies an implementation of Grid_bcApplyToRegionMixedGds.

D eosMode determines how to operate on thermodynamic quantities.
D & Possible values are "dens_ie", where density and internal energy
D & are supplied and pressure and temperature are returned;
D & "dens_pres", where density and pressure are given and energy and
D & temperature are computed;  and "dens_temp", where density and temperature 
D & are given and pressure and energy are computed.
D & Other values may also be available as, depending
D & on whether a multiTemp Eos is used and on implementation of
D & additional physics. For 3T simulations, the best choice is 
D & "dens_ie_recal_gather", since this mode will ensure that 
D & total energy is conserved when refinement changes occur.

D eosModeInit determines how to operate on thermodynamic quantities
D & for the initial conditions.  A call to Simulation_initBlock sets
D & initial conditions on each block, and an eos call follows which
D & ensures the initial values are thermodynamically consistent.  The
D & value of eosModeInit determines the mode in which these eos calls
D & operate.  Possible values are "dens_ie", where density and
D & internal energy are supplied and pressure and temperature are
D & returned; "dens_pres", where density and pressure are given and
D & energy and temperature are computed; and "dens_temp", where
D & density and temperature are given and pressure and energy are
D & computed.  Other values may also be available as, depending
D & on whether a multiTemp Eos is used and on implementation of
D & additional physics.
