    allowDtSTSDominate [BOOLEAN] [FALSE]
        allow a situation in which dt_STS becomes larger than dt_Hydro
        (dt_advection) (assuming that diffusion dt is smaller than advection dt)
        upto advection one, but not faster than the advection advancement. This
        will be useful in solving PDE systems that are hyperbolic + parabolic.
        FALSE will use the STS algorithm to even accelerate advection time
        advancement, which in turn, will use larger advection dt than advection
        dt from CFL limits. This will be useful in solving only hyperbolic PDE
        systems in general. When hyperbolic + parabolic PDE system is to be
        solved, then we suggest that users use less agressive super time
        stepping method by using useSTSforDiffusion = TRUE.
    dr_abortPause [INTEGER] [2]
        Valid Values: 0 to INFTY
        When Driver_abortFlash is called to abnormally end execution, and
        dr_abortPause is grater than zero, the FLASH Driver_abortFlash code will
        sleep for dr_abortPause seconds after writing explanatory messages (to
        standard output and, possibly, to log files) but before calling
        MPI_ABORT. See also eachProcWritesOwnAbortLog for controlling the
        generation of per-processor log files.
    dr_dtMinBelowAction [INTEGER] [1]
        Valid Values: 0, 1
        Action to take when computed new timestep is below dr_dtMinContinue. Use
        0 for none (abort immediately), 1 for "write checkpoint then abort"
    dr_dtMinContinue [REAL] [0.0]
        Valid Values: 0.0 to INFTY
        Minimum computed timestep to continue the simulation
    dr_printTStepLoc [BOOLEAN] [TRUE]

    dr_shortenLastStepBeforeTMax [BOOLEAN] [FALSE]
        If TRUE, make the dt for the last time step shorter if necassary so as
        to avoid overshooting tmax.
    dr_tstepSlowStartFactor [REAL] [0.1]
        Valid Values: 0.0 to INFTY
        The initial dt is set to be at most the timestep computed by CFL
        conditions applied to certain operators multiplied with this factor.

        Valid Values: Unconstrained

        Valid Values: Unconstrained

    eachProcWritesOwnAbortLog [BOOLEAN] [FALSE]
        Should each process writes messages to its own log file when
        Driver_abortFlash gets called to abnormally end execution? If true, each
        process in which Driver_abortFlash is called will attempt to write an
        explanatory message to its own log file, whether that file already
        existed or needs to be newly created.  If false, the Driver_abortFlash
        message will appear only in the regular log file (if the Logfile code
        unit is used), and normally only when Driver_abortFlash is called by the
        process with PE 0.

        The initial time step dt is multiplied with this factor at every
        timestep, until it is limited by CFL condition, allowing users to
        specify a very conservative initial dt and letting it grow by specifying
        a tstep_change_factor > 1.0.
